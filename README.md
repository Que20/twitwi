# twitwi

`twitwi` is a command line Twitter client.
With `twitwi` you can scroll over yout feed in your terminal, like, quote and retweet, but also manage your follower and your lists.

## Why ?

So the other day, I was trying to find a tool that would allow me to do one simple thing :
Create a list name "Swift" and put all of my followers that had the mention "Swift" in their bio. Just couldn't find it so I made this project. I was able to just display a list of my followers, grep it to find the Swift persons and then, just add them to the list. A simple usecase.
Also I was willing to play around with Swift+Argment Parser.
